# NodePort
# Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort).
# Just like in docker we exposed nginx container at host level(host port) Here we are exposing at node level (Node port). K8s willn randomly open these ports. These ports are called as ephemeral ports. (ephemeral ports range linux: 32768-60999)
# NOTE: If we use NodePort, it will open the port in each and every node inside the cluster.
